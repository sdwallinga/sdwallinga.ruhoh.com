My mother, like many, isn't exactly what you'd call tech-savvy. Recently, and somewhat reluctantly, she joined Facebook, providing the rest of our family with plenty of - dare I say, *entertainment* -- as she learns to navigate the sea of 'likes' and 'friends'. I helped her turn configure her notifications so she'd only see the 'people [she] actually cared about hearing about." I explained to her that the ads on the sidebar were exactly that - trying to sell her something. Just the other day, she participated in her first instant messaging session over Facebook's Chat application. Her first *ever* - in October of 2012.

Instant messaging is such an integral element of communication for the Millenial generation. We practically grew up with it. I was hanging out with my friends over AIM in junior high - trying to write the coolest, edgiest, Geocities-style-HTML-ridden "profile" pages. We all were. Now, nearly a decade later, my mother has sent and recieved her first instant message. It really puts things in perspective. Sure, we laugh when our parents call us in to "fix their email" or forget to plug in the printer. But they merely adopted the technology - [*I was born in it, moulded by it*](http://www.iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/bane-dirty-car-drawing-batman-1344986258P.jpg).

One thing that particularly irks my Mom is spam email. She seems to take personal offense when a message informs her that "her bank statement had a discrepancy and requires an account number and social security number to verify". I get hundreds of these things a day through my various addresses, why would they bother her so much? They stay cozy in their Gmail-imposed quarantine zone, where they're not hurting anyone. Sometimes the Engrish is even amusing! But she isn't buying it. I finally asked why they get to her so much, and the answer really got me thinking. 

"Mom, you know you don't have to read them just because they were sent to you, right?" "Yeah. It's not that I get so many of them, though, it's just that people are so *evil*. These people are all just trying to steal your information." 

We all know that, sure. But have you ever considered what it really means? I personally ignore at least a hundred attempts at theft a day. I shrug off would be con-men and snake oil salesman without as much as a thought. But how many people out there, how many ladies much littler and older then my Mom, actually fall for these? Surely it must be some - else, why would the spammers continue? Cast your net wide, and sooner or later you're bound to catch a fish. There are [144.8 billion email messages sent per day](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2012-2016-Executive-Summary.pdf), and, for this past week, [72.9% of them were spam messages](https://www.trustwave.com/support/labs/spam_statistics.asp). Yikes. 

So much of the Internet is garbage. So much of it is crawling with robots who want nothing more then to steal your data, passwords, cat, and identity. But we, the fearless Millenials, trudge onwards. We fear no evil, simply because we've learned to overlook it. Anonymity is a powerful, scary thing. They say character is who you are when no one's looking - this doesn't speak well for the internet as a whole. As an unregulated, decentralized community, it is possible (and probable) that anything can, and has, flourished. Need proof? I've been talking with some friends recently about the deep web - all of the web that even Google is afraid to point you to (that's a lie -- they're just pages that aren't indexed, hence, [aren't searchable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web)). Think you've seen all the Internet has to offer? Grab [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), do some spelunking, and get back to me[1]. 

Just some stuff to chew on. Either way, the Internet is awesome. Just like any big city, it has its good and bad neighborhoods. Know where you are, know where you shouldn't be, and reap all the benefits she has to offer. Especially this goofy [Batman gif](http://i.imgur.com/TiwnR.gif). 

[1]: Seriously, be careful if you go on the Deep Web. Don't do illegal things. Common sense still applies.
