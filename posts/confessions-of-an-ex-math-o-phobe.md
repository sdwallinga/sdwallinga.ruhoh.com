##### *...in which our humble author reconciles years of math anxiety*


For the longest time, Math and I weren't on speaking terms. I'm able to trace it back to the third grade. I distinctly recall a conversation between my teacher, my parents, and myself that involved a seven-year-old me vehemently denying allegations of throwing away my homework. My rock solid defense? "I recycled it!" Facepalms ensue from all parties.

It's true, I wasn't a big fan of homework. Heck, I'm still not. Tonight, however, I decided to settle down in the ninja lab and pound out my calculus homework. I'm taking Calculus I, after nearly a five-year math hiatus since my junior year of high school. Here I am, in my fourth year of post-secondary education, in a 100-level math course. As I was slurping down a cup of Dunkin' Donuts' finest amidst a room of starry-eyed freshmen, I had a realization. *This is easy.*

It was all downhill for Math and I after that failed intervention in the third grade. Sure, basic arithmetic went well enough - even [capuchin monkeys](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12484-monkeys-learn-to-do-arithmetic-for-peanuts.html) can handle that. The rest of elementary school went by relatively painlessly, if I recall. Shoot, I even ended up in an *accelerated* math program somehow. But then, middle school hit. Just as everyone's body started to do strange things, so did math. Suddenly, I was facing an onslaught of x's and y's and weird curvy-pointy symbols I'd never seen before... it was the beginning of the end. I was able to persevere by the skin of my teeth. 

Cut to high school. Stuff happened, like it tends to, and it's the end of my sophomore year. I'm wearing ridiculous plaid pants and my Algebra II teacher is strongly reccomending that I'm not ready for precalculus. So I don't take it. I take some silly probability and statistics course, find some even-more-ridiculous paisley pants, and call it quits. At this point, I planned to pursue a music degree, and none of the schools I was interested in required more then the school-set minum mathematics curriculum. 

Long story short, I get sick of studying music. I do my time in community college taking every general education course under the sun (save for math, mind you). I learn a lot about myself, all that good stuff. I decide that I should probably study something that might get me a [job](http://2media.nowpublic.net/images//56/7d/567d4330074c3b1bfe5065581ea096db.jpg) someday. I like computers. Let's study computer science! Turns out I need to get through Calculus III for my bachelor's degree. Time to man up. 

I enroll in the course, buy my several hundred dollar textbook, and prepare my brain for the mental reaming of a lifetime. A couple class sessions later, a question burns -- is that it? TThis makes sense. This is not supposed to make sense. I am bad at math. I've always been bad at math. 

I skipped precalculus. Didn't feel like taking an extra course over the summer. I still count on my fingers, and frequently turn to the sage advice of [Sal Khan](http://www.khanacademy.org) for help. But here I am, doing math - *well*. It seems like it's not about the process as much as the end result now. I actually get to create deliverables! Truth is, I was never bad at math - I'm just bad at algebra. When I'm removed from the number-crunching, the sprawling polynomials, I can hold my own. Naturally, I'd like to get there at some point, but it's a start. What's more, I find myself even *enjoying* math. I never thought I would say that in my life. 

Does this say something about pre-collegiate math education? Was I just too lazy? Too concerned with goofy pants? Perhaps a combination of all of them. Regardless, here's to the beginning of a beautiful friendship...

...Here's lookin' at Euclid.
